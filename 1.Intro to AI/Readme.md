  <h1>What is AI?</h1>

  <p>AI stands for artificial intelligence. But you already knew that, didn't you? I'm sure that a simple one-line explanation is not why you clicked on this course. You're probably here because you want to dive deeper, to explore more, to learn skills, and to apply those skills. Well, let's get right into it then!</p>

  <h2>What is the full form of AI?</h2>

  <p>AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.</p>

  <h2>What is AI? (for real this time)</h2>

  <p>AI is like teaching a computer to think and make decisions like a human. When we say "teaching a computer to think," we mean developing programs that can process and analyze information in a way that resembles human thinking. Instead of following strict pre-defined rules, AI systems can adapt and learn from examples or experiences.</p>

  <p>For example, let's consider image recognition. Teaching a computer to recognize cats in images traditionally involved manually programming rules like "if the image has pointy ears, whiskers, and a tail, it's likely a cat." However, with AI, we can train a computer to make "intelligent" decisions. We provide it with a large dataset of images labeled as "cat" or "not cat," and the computer automatically learns to recognize patterns that indicate the presence of a cat. It learns by adjusting its internal parameters until it becomes good at distinguishing cats from other objects.</p>

  <p>AI aims to create machines or software that can perceive, reason, learn, and make decisions similar to humans. It encompasses a broad range of techniques, methodologies, and subfields, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, and more. AI systems can be designed for specific tasks or developed as general-purpose AI that aims to exhibit human-like intelligence across multiple domains.</p>

  <h2>ML, AI, NLP jargon, jargon...?</h2>

  <p>If you've come across the term AI, you must also have heard the terms ML, AI, NLP, LLMs, Neural Network, etc. flying around. In this section, we'll understand what they are, how they are different, and how they are similar to each other.</p>

  <h3>Models</h3>

  <p>A model is like a machine that learns from examples. Just like when you learn something new by looking at examples or practicing, a model learns by seeing lots of examples or data.</p>

  <p>Imagine you want to build a model that can recognize different fruits. You start by showing it many pictures of apples, oranges, and bananas. The model looks at these pictures and learns the characteristics of each fruit. It learns what makes an apple different from an orange or a banana.</p>

  <p>After learning from the examples, the model becomes smarter. Now, when you show it a new picture of a fruit, it can tell you what fruit it is based on what it has learned. It might say, "That's an orange!" or "That's a banana!"</p>

  <p>The more examples you give to a model and the better the quality of those examples, the smarter the model becomes. But keep in mind, models are not perfect. Sometimes they make mistakes, just like we do when we're learning something new.</p>

  <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>

  <p>NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP aims to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The field of NLP involves developing algorithms, models, and techniques to process and analyze natural language data. This includes tasks such as question & answers, sentiment analysis, etc.</p>

  <p>Tokens refer to the units or chunks of text that a model processes during training or inference. Text is divided into tokens to make it easier for the model to understand and analyze.</p>
h1>Machine Learning (ML)</h1>

  <p>It is a branch of artificial intelligence which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</p>

  <p>Machine learning is an important component of the growing field of data science. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, and to uncover key insights in data mining projects.</p>

  <h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>

  <h3>Supervised Machine Learning</h3>

  <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where we give the algorithm labeled examples to learn from. It uses these examples to classify new data or predict outcomes accurately. The algorithm adjusts its settings based on the labeled data until it can make good predictions. Some methods used in supervised learning are neural networks, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.</p>

  <h3>Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>

  <p>Unsupervised learning is when the algorithm analyzes data without any labels. It looks for patterns and groupings on its own. This type of learning is useful for tasks like exploring data, finding similar items, and reducing the number of features in a model. Some methods used in unsupervised learning are neural networks, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis.</p>

  <h3>Semi-Supervised Learning</h3>

  <p>Semi-supervised learning combines labeled and unlabeled data to train the algorithm. It uses a small labeled dataset to guide the learning process from a larger unlabeled dataset. This helps when we don't have enough labeled data or labeling is expensive.</p>

  <h3>Reinforcement Machine Learning</h3>

  <p>Reinforcement learning is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm learns through trial and error. It takes actions in an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Over time, it learns to make better decisions to maximize its overall reward. For example, the IBM Watson system that won Jeopardy! used reinforcement learning to learn when to answer questions and how much to wager.</p>

  <h3>Neural Networks</h3>

  <p>The field of neural networks is a sub-field of ML. Neural networks are computer models that are inspired by how our brains work. They are made up of small units called neurons (yeah, just like the brain) that are connected to each other. These neurons take inputs, process them, and produce outputs.</p>

  <p>Neural networks have different layers. The first layer takes the input, like numbers or images. The middle layers, called hidden layers, process the information, and the final layer gives the output, which can be a prediction or a decision.</p>

  <p>During the learning process, the network adjusts its connections to get better at its task. It does this by comparing its predictions with the correct answers and making small changes to its connections to get closer to the right answer. Sort of like learning from examples.</p>

  <h3>Deep Learning</h3>

  <p>Deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks. The term "deep" refers to the depth of the network, meaning it has many layers stacked on top of each other.</p>

  <p>In deep learning, the neural networks are designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. Each layer of the network processes the input and passes it to the next layer, allowing the network to learn increasingly complex features or abstractions as it goes deeper into the network.</p>

  <p>The main advantage of deep learning is its ability to automatically discover and extract relevant features from raw data without the need for manual feature engineering. Instead of explicitly specifying what features to look for, deep learning models learn these features from the data itself through a process called training.</p>

  <h2>Applications of AI</h2>

  <p>In this day and age, with all the tooling that is available, thereâ€™s no limitation to what can be built. Even if youâ€™re not using AI in your build, you can use AI to help you build your product out. However, if youâ€™re using AI to the fullest, here are some of its applications for you to get inspired by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Virtual Assistants: AI-powered virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant can understand and respond to human voice commands, providing information, performing tasks, and controlling smart devices.</li>
    <li>Autonomous Vehicles: AI plays a crucial role in self-driving cars, enabling them to perceive the environment, make decisions, and navigate safely.</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity: AI is employed for detecting and preventing cyber threats, identifying unusual patterns in network traffic, and enhancing system security.</li>
    <li>Recommendation Systems: That TikTok/ Reels rabbit hole youâ€™ve fallen into? Yeah, blame AI for it (along with the companies, of course). AI-powered recommendation systems are used in e-commerce, entertainment, and content streaming platforms to suggest products, movies, or music based on user preferences and behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Conclusion:</p>

  <p>As you can see, AI is an extremely vast field and there are a lot of intersecting sub-fields. It is actively changing the world we live in. There are many more applications than the ones that weâ€™ve listed here, but for the sake of respecting your reduced attention span (thanks to you-know-what), weâ€™ll wrap this lesson up for now. In the next one, weâ€™re gonna learn about LLMs and how they made it possible to build the college assignment solver that we all know and love as ChatGPT ðŸ˜†</p>
